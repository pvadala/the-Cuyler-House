            <p>Abolitionists used a diversity of tactics to achieve their goals. Among those tactics were those of
                subterfuge: hiding in plain sight, falsifying documents, even building homes from the ground-up to
                provide hidden spaces unknown to the state and difficult to detect by an invading force without close
                scrutiny. <br> <br> The Cuyler House was one such house.</p>
