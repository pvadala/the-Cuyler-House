            <p>

                The Underground Railroad developed as a need for African American slaves to escape the horrors of slavery in the South and head North to Canada or to Northern States in America that were considered Free States.  Much of the history of the Southern routes to the North are oral but changes to written the closer it gets to Maryland, New York , Ohio, and Pennsylvania. What is generally known of the southern routes is they were near bodies of water: rivers, lakes, creeks and marshes because dogs could not pick up a trail in water. Learning how to follow the North Star and The Big Dipper to Ohio and Canada through the use of various codes including Quilts, Songs and markings on trees and Safe Houses along the way. The Alabama River, The Tombigbee Waterways, Black Warrior River, and the Cahawba River down to Mobile and back up to Huntsville in North Alabama are the most likely routes in Alabama. From North Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky into Ohio where there were networks of people leading into Canada and New York. Below are several links to videos, examples of codes and quilts and songs used as code for the Underground Railroad. One video shows the discovery of a safe House in Selma, Alabama </p>
