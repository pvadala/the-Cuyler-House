            <p>The Cuyler House was built in two phases, the first iteration was a gothic cottage, built in 1855. After the cottage was built, the neighborhood was growing and prospering with many professional folks building larger, more opulent structures (one of the first waves of gentrification). The Cuyler House was not immune to the fashion of the day, and so a larger Victorian Queen Anne was built surrounding the gothic cottage. Whether by luck or determination of design, a structure was built that made it easy to usher folks from one side of the house to the other. As well, an “alternate” foundation was laid, a water cistern was added as well as a secret door meant to be hidden behind a bed-stead, as well as stairs housing hidden drawers for documents.

                These hallmarks are well-known features utilized in underground railroad “stations” or houses that hid escaping enslaved persons on their trek to Canada, a free Country.
                
                The neighborhood that the Cuyler House is in, Historic Hawley-Green lies on the well-worn Freedom Trail through Syracuse, NY. 1
